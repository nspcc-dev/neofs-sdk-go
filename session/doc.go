/*
Package session collects functionality of the NeoFS sessions.

Sessions are used in NeoFS as a mechanism for transferring the power of attorney
of actions to another network member.

Session tokens represent proof of trust. Each session has a limited lifetime and
scope related to some NeoFS service: [Object], [Container], etc.

Both parties agree on a secret (private session key), the possession of which
will be authenticated by a trusted person. The principal confirms his trust by
signing the public part of the secret (public session key).

The trusted member can perform operations on behalf of the trustee.
