/*
Package netmap provides functionality for working with information about the
NeoFS network, primarily a layer of storage nodes.

The package concentrates all the characteristics of NeoFS networks.

NetMap represents NeoFS network map - one of the main technologies used to
store data in the system. It is composed of information about all storage nodes
(NodeInfo type) in a particular network. NetMap methods allow you to impose
container storage policies (PlacementPolicy type) on a fixed composition of
nodes for selecting nodes corresponding to the placement rules chosen by the
container creator.

NetworkInfo type is dedicated to descriptive characterization of network state
and settings.

Using package types in an application is recommended to potentially work with
different protocol versions with which these types are compatible.
